This is a repository for my ALX Software Engineering High Level Programming Language projects.
For this sprint we are focusing on Python.

Python is an easy to learn,powerful programming language.It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object oriented programming.

Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
